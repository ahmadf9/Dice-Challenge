# Dice-Challenge

TODO:
Step 1 - Create an External
Create a new Javascript file called index.js and link to it from the index.html file.

Step 2 - Add Dice Images
In the Dicee project, there is a folder called images, add the images of dice6.png as the source to both of the <img> elements.

Step 3 - Create a Random Number
Inside index.js, create a new variable called randomNumber1 then set the value of this variable to a random number between 1 and 6. Test it out in the console to make sure it works as expected.

Step 4 - Change the <img> to a Random Dice
Use the random number you created in the last step to pick out a random dice image between dice1.png to dice 6.png then place this image inside the left <img> element.

Step 5 - Change both <img> Elements
Do the same for the right hand side image element.
